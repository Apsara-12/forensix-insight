🚀 ForensiX AI – Intelligent Document Fraud Detection Platform
AI‑Powered Forensic Intelligence for the Digital Era

ForensiX AI is a production‑level AI forensic web application designed to detect whether a document is GENUINE or FORGED using multi‑layer intelligent analysis.
The system combines metadata forensics, linguistic intelligence, signature verification, and handwriting analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) to provide transparent and reliable results.

👩‍💻 Team Members
This project is collaboratively developed by:

Cliffe Jose J – AI Analysis & System Design

Ancy Antony A L – Frontend Development & UI/UX Design

🎯 Project Vision
Traditional document verification relies heavily on manual inspection.
ForensiX AI automates forensic analysis using Artificial Intelligence to:

✅ Detect document fraud
✅ Provide explainable decisions
✅ Highlight suspicious evidence
✅ Generate professional forensic reports
✅ Deliver startup‑level SaaS experience

📊 Intelligent Fraud Scoring System
Weighted analysis model:

Module	Weight
Metadata Analysis	25%
Linguistic Analysis	30%
Signature Analysis	25%
Handwriting Analysis	20%
Final Decision Logic

Score > 0.6  → 🔴 FORGED
Score ≤ 0.6 → 🟢 GENUINE
Confidence = Score × 100
